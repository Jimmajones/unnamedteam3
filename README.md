# Pokeset

## About

Pokeset is a web application that allows for easy recording and querying of
custom Pokemon. Randomizers are popular game modifications wherein various
elements of a game that were previously static are made random. This app
is intended to be used for storing information from a playthrough of a
randomized Pokemon game. Where the in-game Pokedex breaks down, Pokeset
picks up the slack!
